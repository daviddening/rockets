`cd ..` //  got to /workspaces
`git clone git@github.com:daviddening/rockets.git` // this info is available from the 'Code' drop down on github

When prompted
`Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? Yes`
`Enter passphrase for key '/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa': <your usual password>`

You should see ‘rockets’ when you ls

```
